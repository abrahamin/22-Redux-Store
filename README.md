# Redux-Store

## Description

The open source JavaScript library Redux is largely known as the industry standard for managing complex state in a large-scale React application. This MERN stack application is an e-commerce platform where users can register for an account, select from various categories, choose products and view their details, and add/remove from the shopping cart. Redux is used to manage the global state of this application. Additionally, payment checkouts are made possible via Stripe.

## User Story

```
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```

## Technologies Used

React, Express, Mongoose, GraphQL, JSON Web Token, Redux, Stripe
